Description: turnkey platform for the neuroscience
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintain a variety of
 neuroscience-oriented (such as AFNI, FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) and many
 generic computational (such as condor, pandas, etc.) software projects
 within Debian.
 .
 This meta-package depends on packages needed for a typical
 NeuroDebian deployment, e.g. enabling the complementary NeuroDebian
 repository of package backports and perspective packages not yet
 available from stock Debian/Ubuntu.


Package: neurodebian-repository
Architecture: all
Pre-depends: neurodebian-keyring, python-minimal, wget
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: netselect
Description: installer of the NeuroDebian APT repository
 Besides making (neuro)scientific software available on stock Debian
 systems, neuro.debian.net (and mirrors around the globe) provides
 a repository with backport builds of the NeuroDebian-maintained
 packages for all supported Debian and Ubuntu releases.
 .
 This package enables NeuroDebian repository on top of the stock
 Debian or Ubuntu system.

Description: neuroscience research environment
 This package contains NeuroDebian artwork (icons, background image)
 and a NeuroDebian menu featuring most popular neuroscience tools
 automatically installed upon initial invocation.


Package: neurodebian-keyring
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: GnuPG archive keys of the NeuroDebian archive
 The NeuroDebian project digitally signs its Release files. This package
 contains the archive keys used for that.

Package: neurodebian-popularity-contest
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, popularity-contest
Description: Helper for NeuroDebian popularity contest submissions
 This package is a complement to the generic popularity-contest
 package to enable anonymous submission of usage statistics to
 NeuroDebian in addition to the popcon submissions to the underlying
 distribution (e.g. Debian or Ubuntu) popcon server.
 .
 Your participation in popcon is important for following reasons:
  - Popular packages receive more attention from developers, bugs are
    fixed faster and updates are provided quicker.
  - Assure that we do not drop support for a previous release of Debian
    or Ubuntu while are active users.
  - User statistics could be used by upstream research software
    developers to acquire funding for continued development.
 .
 It has an effect only if you have decided to participate in the
 Popularity Contest of your distribution, i.e. Debian or Ubuntu.
 You can always enable or disable your participation in popcon by
 running 'dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest' as root.

Description: NeuroDebian guest additions (DO NOT INSTALL OUTSIDE VIRTUALBOX)

 in a VirtualBox-based virtual machine for NeuroDebian.
 .
 DO NOT install this package unless you know what you are doing! For example,
 installation of this package relaxes several security mechanisms.
