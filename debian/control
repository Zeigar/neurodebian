Depends: python, wget, neurodebian-archive-keyring, ${misc:Depends}
Recommends: netselect
Suggests: neurodebian-desktop, neurodebian-popularity-contest
Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - repository configuration
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 This package enables the NeuroDebian repository on top of a standard
 Debian or Ubuntu system.

Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - development tools
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 This package provides sources and development tools used by
 NeuroDebian to provide backports for a range of Debian/Ubuntu
 releases.

Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - desktop integration
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 This package provides NeuroDebian artwork (icons, background image)
 and a NeuroDebian menu featuring the most popular neuroscience tools,
 which will be automatically installed upon initial invocation.

Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - GnuPG archive keys
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 The NeuroDebian project digitally signs its Release files. This package
 contains the archive keys used for that.

Description: neuroscience-oriented distribution - popcon integration
 The NeuroDebian project integrates and maintains a variety of software
 projects within Debian that are useful for neuroscience (such as AFNI,
 FSL, PsychoPy, etc.) or generic computation (such as HTCondor,
 pandas, etc.).
 .
 This package is a complement to the generic popularity-contest
 package to enable anonymous submission of usage statistics to
 NeuroDebian in addition to the popcon submissions to the underlying
 distribution (either Debian or Ubuntu) popcon server.
 .
 Participating in popcon is important for the following reasons:
  * Popular packages receive more attention from developers; bugs are
    fixed faster and updates are provided quicker.
  * It ensures that support is not dropped for a previous release of
    Debian or Ubuntu while there are active users.
  * User statistics may be useful for upstream research software
    developers seeking funding for continued development.
 .
 This requires that popcon is activated for the underlying distribution
 (Debian or Ubuntu), which can be achieved by running
 "dpkg-reconfigure popularity-contest" as root.
