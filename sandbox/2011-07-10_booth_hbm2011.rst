NeuroDebian@HBM2011.ca
======================

From June 26-30 the annual meeting of the Organization for Human Brain Mapping
(HBM2011_) took place in Quebec City, Canada, and we ran another booth
encouraged by our :ref:`positive experience at last year's SfN in San Diego
<chap_debian_booth_sfn2010>`. The setup was pretty much the same as last year:
Some chairs and tables, lots of people, our `tri-fold flyers`_, a Debian mirror
and some virtual machine images to show Debian in action. We had many curious
people have their first exposure to Debian, and long-time users expressing
their gratitude to Debian. But that is nothing new, so let's talk about the
differences to last year's booth.

First of all, we had more people at the booth. Dominique Belhachemi volunteered
to help us out -- and that was very much appreciated. Although HBM has only
about a tenth of the attendees that SfN has, we had significantly more traffic.
While last year people were primarily interested in knowing about the project,
this time many of them wanted to give it a try immediately. People came with
their laptops, got the VM images and started playing with Debian. After a day
or so, some came back and asked for recommendations on particular software --
after having been exposed to the wealth of the Debian archive.

What also had increased was the number of developers, or rather research labs
developing neuroimaging software that came to the booth to discuss how to get
their software into Debian and how to arange ongoing maintenance of these
future Debian packages. As we have our plates already quite full, we spend time
on mentoring interested developers to learn the art of Debian packaging and
making them familiar with Debian's procedures and standards (e.g. working on
`#609820`_).

Two promising new developments need to be mentioned. First, we were approached
by companies that develop hardware for brain-imaging and psychophysics
research. They were curious to learn about Debian as an integrated platform
that offers free software solutions that an increasing amount of their
customers demands (e.g. PsychoPy_). Apparently, the movement towards open
research software has finally made it into the business plans of companies, as
they seem to start perceiving compatibility with free software systems as a
competitive advantage. We explained how software gets into Debian and how its
release cycle is managed.  Let's see whether we see more "Debian-certified"
research products in the future.

Lastly, we started talking with folks from the INCF_ to explore possibilities of
collaborating on INCF projects using Debian as the integration and development
platform. The INCF is an `OECD-funded`_ organization that develops collaborative
neuroinformatics infrastructure and promotes the sharing of data and computing
resources to the international research community. At least one INCF project is
already relying on the efforts of the NeuroDebian project. We are going to continue
this discussion during a workshop in September. A report will follow...
