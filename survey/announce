Dear neuroscience researchers and their IT staff

We invite you to participate in a survey on software usage and computing
environments in neuroscience research. It will take no more than five minutes
to fill it out. Immediately after sending your answers you will see a summary
of how other participants have responded before.

Learn about what fellow neuroscientists are doing to address their computing
demands -- take the survey!
