Dear neuroscience researchers and their IT staff

We invite you to participate in a survey on software usage and computing
environments in neuroscience research. It will take no more than five
minutes to fill it out. Immediately after sending your answers you will
get to see a summary of how other participants have responded before.
This data will eventually be made available to software vendors and
distributors to determine advantages and issue of popular computing
environments in neuroscience research.

Learn about what fellow neuroscientists are doing to address their computing
demands -- take the survey!
