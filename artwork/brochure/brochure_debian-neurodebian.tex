\ndsection{Debian}

was founded by Ian Murdock in August 1993 with the goal
to create an easy-to-install and maintain non-commercial GNU/Linux
operating system that would be able to compete in the
commercial market.  Since then Debian established itself as an
independent and unique project driven by more than 3000
enthusiastic contributors all around the globe.
Principles of \emph{do-ocracy} and democracy backed up by evolving transparent
standards allowed Debian to deliver the most comprehensive operating system -- not
only by amount of integrated software, but also by
number of the supported hardware architectures.
% Current installer of Debian has been translated more that to 60 languages.
% (12 ???  officially supported architectures).
% Well appreciated
The high quality and openness of Debian made it the foundation of choice for
more than 120 derivative GNU/Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu and
Mint.

The code names of Debian releases are names of characters from the Toy
Story animation, e.g. sid, squeeze, lenny.  \emph{Unstable}
flavor always called \emph{sid}, while a new name chosen for every
upcoming release and assigned to \emph{Testing} to become a code name

\ndsubsection{Debian enthusiastic experts}
% could be simply 'Debian People' or 'Debian Community'

Debian is the only major operating system developed
solely by volunteer individuals who collaborate via the Internet.
Debian developers, teams or individual contributors improve the operating
system not by writing new applications (in most cases), but by
\begin{itemize}[nolistsep,topsep=0em,leftmargin=1pc]
\item integrating existing software into Debian
\item fixing and communicating bug reports to original developers
\item assuring overall quality of the distribution
\item improving documentation and translations
\item providing user support
\end{itemize}

Packaged software in Debian have individual maintainers who are
often also users of a particular software, and who are therefore interested in its
reliable operation. Certain fields of applications have dedicated maintainer
teams, such as Debian-Science or Debian-Med.

\begin{comment}
\ndsection{Reasons to choose Debian}
\paragraph{It is maintained by its users}

If something needs to be fixed or improved, we just do it.

\paragraph{Unparalleled support}

Mail sent to the mailing lists often gets answers within 15 minutes (or less),
for free, and by the people who developed it. Compare that to typical phone
support: hours spent on the phone, for money, only to get someone who doesn't
know the system well enough to even understand your question.

\paragraph{You wouldn't be alone in your choice}

A wide range of organizations and individuals use Debian. See our Who's Using
Debian? page for a description of some high-profile sites which use Debian, and
have chosen to submit a short description of how they use Debian and why.

\paragraph{The best packaging system in the world.}

Tired of old files from software three versions old cluttering your system? Or
installing a piece of software only to find it causes your system to crash
because of software conflicts? Dpkg, Debian's endured packaging system, takes
care of these issues for you.

\paragraph{Easy installation}

If you have heard that GNU/Linux is difficult to install, then you haven't
tried Debian lately. We are constantly improving the installation process. You
can do the installation directly from CD, DOS, floppies or even over the
network.

\paragraph{Incredible amounts of software}

Debian comes with over 25000 different pieces of software. Every bit of it is
free. If you have proprietary software that runs under GNU/Linux, you can still
use it - in fact, there may even be an installer in Debian that will
automatically install and set up everything for you.

\paragraph{Packages well integrated}

Debian surpasses all other distributions in how well its packages are
integrated. Since all software is packaged by a coherent group, not only can
all packages be found at a single site, but you can be assured that we have
already worked out all issues regarding complicated dependencies. While we feel
that the deb format has some advantages over the rpm format, it is the
integration between the packages that makes a Debian system more robust.

\paragraph{Source code}

If you are a software developer, you will appreciate the fact that there are
hundreds of development tools and languages, plus millions of lines of source
code in the base system. All of the software in the main distribution meets the
criteria of the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG). This means that you can
freely use this code to study from, or to incorporate into new free software
projects. There are also plenty of tools and code suitable for use in
proprietary projects.

\paragraph{Easy upgrades}

Due to our packaging system, upgrading to a new version of Debian is a snap.
Just run apt-get update ; apt-get dist-upgrade (or aptitude update; aptitude
dist-upgrade in newer releases) and you can upgrade from a CD in a matter of
minutes or point apt at one of the over 300 Debian mirrors and upgrade over the
net.

\rotatebox{90}{\includegraphics[height=.9\columnwidth]{distro-dev}}
\rotatebox{90}{Description}

\paragraph{Multiple architectures and kernels}

Currently Debian supports an impressive number of CPU architectures: alpha,
amd64, armel, hppa, i386, ia64, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, and sparc. It also
runs on GNU Hurd and FreeBSD kernels besides Linux, and with the debootstrap
utility you will be hard-pressed to find a device that can't run Debian.

\paragraph{Bug tracking system}

Debian's bug tracking system is publicly available. We don't try to hide the
fact that software doesn't always work the way users want. Users are encouraged
to submit bug reports and are notified when and why the bug was closed. This
system allows Debian to respond to problems quickly and honestly.

\ndsection{NeuroDebian is}

a Debian project aiming to provide the Neuroscience community with a
stable and versatile research platform -- the Debian OS.
Since 2005, NeuroDebian integrates neuroscience software into the Debian
operating system to allow neuroscientists to benefit from the advantages of
the universal operating system in their day-to-day research activities.
The NeuroDebian repository
(\url{http://neuro.debian.net}) offers the latest research software for
all Debian suites (and various releases of Ubuntu).
The combination of a stable generic
operating system, Debian, and a variety of conveniently accessible research
software creates a versatile research platform for neuroscience that offers the
latest methodologies of the field for everyone, for free.
These advantages make NeuroDebian increasingly popular among
neuroscientists and scientific software developers.

by the NeuroDebian project targets the official Debian operating system. This
approach helps to increase the longevity of the project by relying on the
efforts of thousands of Debian contributors.

\ndsubsection{Benefits from Debian integration}

\begin{itemize}[nolistsep,leftmargin=1pc]

% rephrase to outline the benefit, not burden
\item Debian standards and policies guarantee quality and robustness

\item Debian centralized bug tracking system provides a unified
  single-point of entry for bug reporting and troubleshooting for any
  software in Debian

\item Debian makes software available through a world-wide distribution
  network, thus offloading bandwidth demands

\item Other Debian enthusiasts take care about large-scale aspects of
  deployment, quality assurance, porting and integration at the level
  of the entire distribution:

\begin{description}[nolistsep,leftmargin=1pc]
\item[Porting] Software sources get built for 11 hardware
  architectures and 3 kernels (Linux, HURD, kFreeBSD). Porter teams
  maintain build infrastructure and help making the code
  platform-agnostic.
\item[QA] Whole-archive rebuilds assure robustness of packaging and
  warn about upcoming problems (core libraries upgrades) beforehand.
\item[Internationalization (I18n)] Translator teams help localizing
  software for more than 60 languages
\end{description}

\item Neuroscience software becomes 1st-class citizen within Debian
  project, which guarantees its availability, longevity, smooth
  installation and upgrades

%\item Participation in the Debian community helps to assure Debian's
%  aptness for the neuroscientific software demands
