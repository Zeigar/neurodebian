Pkg-Description: Brain Computer Interface (BCI) framework
 Pyff is a Pythonic Feedback Framework which provides a platform
 independent framework to develop BCI feedback applications in
 Python. It was designed to make the development of feedback
 applications as easy as possible.  Pyff framework moves feedback
 implementations to a general purpose, and easy to learn language like
 Python. Python provides many so called bindings to other libraries,
 which allow it to develop high quality multimedia feedback
 applications, with little effort.
 .
 The framework communicates with the rest of the BCI system via a
 standardized communication protocol using UDP and XML and is
 therefore suitable to be used with any BCI system that may be adapted
 to send its control signal via UDP in the specified format.
