Pkg-Description: toolbox for MEG and EEG analysis
 The software includes algorithms for simple and advanced analysis of MEG and
 EEG data, such as time-frequency analysis, source reconstruction using dipoles,
 distributed sources and beamformers and non-parametric statistical testing. It
 supports the data formats of all major MEG systems (CTF, Neuromag, BTi) and of
 the most popular EEG systems, and new formats can be added easily. FieldTrip
 contains high-level functions that you can use to construct your own analysis
 protocols in Matlab. Furthermore, it easily allows developers to incorporate
 low-level algorithms for new EEG/MEG analysis methods.
Remark: The NIMH distributes a "port" of fieldtrip to Octave (at
 http://kurage.nimh.nih.gov/meglab/Meg/Software). It needs to be figured out
 whether this port can be incorporated into the official version, and to what
 degree it is complete. Packaging fieldtrip is required to complete the
 packaging of SPM8.
