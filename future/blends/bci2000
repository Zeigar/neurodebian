Pkg-Description: platform for brain-computer interface systems
 BCI2000 supports a variety of data acquisition systems, brain
 signals, and study/feedback paradigms. During operation, BCI2000
 stores data in a common format (BCI2000 native or GDF), along with
 all relevant event markers and information about system
 configuration. BCI2000 also includes several tools for data
 import/conversion (e.g., a routine to load BCI2000 data files
 directly into Matlab) and export facilities into ASCII.
 .
 BCI2000 also facilitates interactions with other software.  For
 example, Matlab scripts can be executed in real-time from within
 BCI2000, or BCI2000 filters can be compiled to execute as stand-alone
 programs.  Furthermore, a simple network-based interface allows for
 interactions with external programs written in any programming
 language.  For example, a robotic arm application that is external to
 BCI2000 may be controlled in real time based on brain signals
 processed by BCI2000, or BCI2000 may use and store along with brain
 signals behavioral-based inputs such as eye-tracker coordinates.
Remark: Besides non-commercial restriction, it is required that
 "ACADEMIC USER must be an investigator / lab director (and not a
 post-doc or student)". Re-distribution (to third-party) is also
 forbidden.
