Pkg-Description: De Bruijn cycle generator
 Continuous carry-over, fMRI experiments present stimuli in a counter-balanced
 sequence, meaning every stimulus precedes and follows every other. Higher
 level counterbalancing is useful to guard against some modeling assumptions
 of the approach and to test for the effects of stimulus history and context.
 Sequences that efficiently provide this control of stimulus order are called
 de Bruijn cycles.
 .
 This package provides a commandline tool to generate de Bruijn cycles.
