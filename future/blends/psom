Pkg-Description: pipeline system for Octave and Matlab
 PSOM is a lightweight library to manage complex multi-stage data processing. A
 pipeline is a collection of jobs, i.e. Matlab or Octave code with a well
 identified set of options that are using files for inputs and outputs. To
 use PSOM, the only requirement is to generate a description of a pipeline in
 the form of a simple Matlab/Octave structure. PSOM then automatically offers
 the following services:
 .
  * Run jobs in parallel using multiple CPUs or within a distributed computing
    environment.
  * Generate log files and keep track of the pipeline execution. These logs are
    detailed enough to fully reproduce the analysis.
  * Handle job failures: successful completion of jobs is checked and failed
    jobs can be restarted.
  * Handle updates of the pipeline: change options or add jobs and let PSOM
    figure out what to reprocess.
