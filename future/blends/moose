Pkg-Description: multiscale simulation environment for neuroscience
 MOOSE is the Multiscale Object-Oriented Simulation Environment. It is the base
 and numerical core for large, detailed simulations including Computational
 Neuroscience and Systems Biology.
 MOOSE spans the range from single molecules to sub-cellular networks, from
 single cells to neuronal networks, and to still larger systems. It is
 backwards-compatible with GENESIS, and forward compatible with Python and
 XML-based model definition standards like SBML and MorphML.
 MOOSE is coordinating with the GENESIS-3 project towards the goals of
 developing educational resources for modeling.
