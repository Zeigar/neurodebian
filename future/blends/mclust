Pkg-Description: Matlab toolbox for clustering of electrophysiologic recordings
  MClust is a toolbox which enables a user to perform automated and
  manual clustering on single-electrode, stereotrode, and tetrode
  recordings. It allows manual corrections to automated clustering
  results. It outputs t-files, which contain (after a header) a list
  of timestamps in binary format. Timestamps are 32-bit longs at a
  resolution of 10 timestamps/ms.
