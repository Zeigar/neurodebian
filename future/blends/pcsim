Pkg-Description: simulator of heterogeneous networks of neurons and synapses
 PCSIM is a tool for simulating heterogeneous networks composed of
 different model neurons and synapses. This simulator is written in
 C++ with a primary interface to the programming language Python. It
 is intended to simulate networks containing up to millions of neurons
 and on the order of billions of synapses. This is achieved by
 distributing the network over different nodes of a computing cluster
 by using MPI.
