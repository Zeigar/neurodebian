Pkg-Description: tools for recording from MEAs and RT processing
 Meabench is a set of interacting linux programs for recording data
 from MEAs and real time processing. It can be used to acquire and
 visualize data from MultiChannel Systems multi-electrode array
 hardware in real time. On-line spike detection is available, as well
 as suppression of artifacts induced by 60 Hz pickup and by
 stimulation. A growing number of small utilities for data analysis is
 included with the source code, and you can easily add your
 own. Meabench provides continuous and triggered recording of raw
 electrode data as well as extracted spike data. Meabench is very
 suitable for real-time feedback stimulation, since roundtrip times
 from pre-amplifier to stimulator is less than 200 ms worst-case (less
 than 50 ms average).
