Pkg-Description: toolbox for rigid and nonrigid registration of images
 elastix is open source software, based on the well-known Insight
 Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK). The software consists of
 a collection of algorithms that are commonly used to solve (medical)
 image registration problems. The modular design of elastix allows the
 user to quickly configure, test, and compare different registration
 methods for a specific application. A command-line interface enables
 automated processing of large numbers of data sets, by means of
 scripting.
