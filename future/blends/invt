Pkg-Description: iLab Neuromorphic Vision C++ Toolkit
 The iLab Neuromorphic Vision C++ Toolkit (iNVT, pronounced
 ``invent'') is a comprehensive set of C++ classes for the development
 of neuromorphic models of vision. Neuromorphic models are
 computational neuroscience algorithms whose architecture and function
 is closely inspired from biological brains. The iLab Neuromorphic
 Vision C++ Toolkit comprises not only base classes for images,
 neurons, and brain areas, but also fully-developed models such as our
 model of bottom-up visual attention and of Bayesian surprise.
