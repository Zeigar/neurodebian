Pkg-Description: platform for analysis of neural signals
 Chronux is a Matlab toolbox for signal processing of neural time
 series data, several specialized mini-packages for spike sorting,
 local regression, audio segmentation and other tasks. It also
 includes a graphical user interface (GUI). The current version of
 the GUI contains a number of features specialised to the analysis of
 electroencephalography (EEG) data. The eventual aim is to provide
 domain speciÔ¨Åc user interfaces (UIs) for each experimental modality,
 along with corresponding data management tools.
Remark: last release more than 2 years ago, and no major vital signs since then
