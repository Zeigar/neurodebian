Pkg-Description: Brain Computer Interface module for Brain Vision Recorder
 This module gives you the possibility to create a Brain Computer
 Interface (BCI), and herewith to get EEG data online and evaluate the
 data while you are receiving it.  The module is made for all users of
 the Brain Vision Recorder because of the therein implemented function
 of Remote Data Access. It is not possible to use it with another EEG
 Recorder Software, but this will be a project in the future.
 .
 Using the PyBCI module, you are able to get a numpy data array in up
 to every few ten milliseconds and therewith evaluate the data almost
 in realtime with other powerful Python packages, for example using
 PyMVPA.
