Pkg-Description: A simulator for networks of spiking neurons
 NEST is a simulation system for large networks of biologically realistic
 point-neurons and neurons with a small number of electrical compartments.
Remark: Mentioned packaging is not providing NEST itself but rather
 only packaging materials so you could build package yourself.
