Pkg-Description: framework for closed-loop neurophysiological experiments
 RELACS is designed as an framework for closed-loop experiments that
 may considerably speed up this traditional approach and in addition
 offers novel experimental possibilities. In a closed-loop experiment
 a stimulus is presented, the resulting response is immediately
 analyzed, and properties of the next stimulus (e.g. mean
 intensity) are adjusted as needed.
 .
 RELACS comes with an extensive set of data-analysis functions. The
 functions are implemented in C++ to allow fast and memory efficient
 data-analysis as it is required for closed-loop experiments:
  - Basic statistics (e.g. mean, standard deviation)
  - Spectral analysis: power spectrum, transfer function, coherence
  - Linear and nonlinear fits (Levenberg-Marquardt and Simplex)
  - Peak detection
  - Histograms, interpolation
  - Stimulus generation: pulse, saw tooth, band-pass filtered white
    noise, Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise
  - Firing rates: mean, binned, convolved with kernels (e.g. rectangle,
    triangle, Gaussian)
  - Interspike intervals: histogram, CV, serial correlation, etc.
  - Spike timing precision: vector strength, reliability, correlation,
    synchrony etc.
 .
 RELACS plugin infrastructure allows to adapt it to specific hardware
 drivers and they allow you to implement research protocols, filters,
 spike detectors, etc.
