Pkg-Description: DTI spatial normalization and atlas construction toolkit
 DTI-TK is a spatial normalization & atlas construction toolkit,
 designed from ground up to support the manipulation of
 diffusion-tensor images (DTI) with special cares taken to respect the
 tensorial nature of the data. It implements a state-of-the-art
 registration algorithm that drives the alignment of white matter (WM)
 tracts by matching the orientation of the underlying fiber bundle at
 each voxel. The algorithm has been shown to both improve WM tract
 alignment and to enhance the power of statistical inference in
 clinical settings.  The key features include:
 .
  - NIfTI support for scalar, vector and DTI volumes
  - tool chains for manipulating DTI volumes: resampling, smoothing,
    warping, registration & visualization
  - pipelines for WM morphometry: spatial normalization & atlas
    construction for population-based studies
  - built-in cluster-computing support
  - interoperability with other major DTI tools: AFNI, Camino,
    DTIStudio & FSL
