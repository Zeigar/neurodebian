Pkg-Description: platform for data management and productivity tasks in neuroimaging
 The primary functionality of XNAT is to provide a place to store and
 control access to neuroimaging data. This includes sophisticated user
 control, search and retrieval, and archiving capabilities. As
 open-source software, XNAT also supports a wide variety of
 research-based processing pipelines, and is able to link up with
 supercomputer processing power to dramatically shorten image
 processing time.
