Pkg-Description: Python interface and tools for Neuroshare
 The Neuroshare API is an interface for accessing electrophysiology data
 from files in proprietary formats. To do so it uses vendor-provided
 shared libraries that can be downloaded free of charge.
 .
 This package provides a high-level Python interface to the Neuroshare
 API that focuses on convenience for the user and enables access to
 all available metadata and data. The data is returned in NumPy arrays,
 which provides a quick route to further examination and analysis.
 .
 In addition, this package contains the ns2hdf converter tool that
 converts neuroshare-compatible files into the HDF5 (Hierarchical Data
 Format, version 5) file format.
