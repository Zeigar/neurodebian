Pkg-Description: IO library for electrophysiological data formats in Python
 NEO stands for Neural Ensemble Objects and is a project to provide common
 class names and concepts for dealing with electro-physiological (in vivo
 and/or simulated) data with the aim of getting OpenElectrophy, NeuroTools,
 G-node and maybe other projects with similar goals more close together.
 .
 In particular Neo provides:
 .
  * a set a classes with precise definitions
  * an IO module that offer a simple API that fit many formats
  * documentation.
  * a set of examples like a format convertor
Remark: Upstream says not worth packaging before v0.2 is released.
