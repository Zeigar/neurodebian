Pkg-Description: platform for brain-computer interface systems
 BCPy2000 provides a platform for rapid, flexible development of
 experimental brain-computer interface systems. It is based on, and
 hosted by, the BCI2000 project. From the developer's point of view,
 the implementation is carried out in Python, taking advantage of
 various high-level packages: VisionEgg for stimulus presentation,
 NumPy and SciPy for signal processing and classification, and IPython
 for interactive debugging.
 .
 Being a BCI2000 system, it is modular, consisting of an Application
 module (the stimulus presentation part), a Signal Processing module
 (the machine-learning part), and a Signal Source module (the toy data
 generation part). You can choose to use Python to implement one, two,
 or all three of these modules, and use other pre-existing BCI2000
 modules for the remainder of the system (for example, for the Signal
 Source, you can choose from BCI2000's comprehensive range of EEG
 acquisition modules). The modules communicate over TCP/IP, so they
 can run on different machines (and possibly different operating
 systems) if necessary.
