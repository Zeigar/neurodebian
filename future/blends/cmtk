Pkg-Description: The Computational Morphometry Toolkit
  A software toolkit for computational morphometry of biomedical
  images, CMTK comprises a set of command line tools and a back-end
  general-purpose library for processing and I/O.
  .
  The command line tools primarily provide the following
  functionality: registration (affine and nonrigid; single and
  multi-channel; pairwise and groupwise), image correction (MR bias
  field estimation; interleaved image artifact correction), processing
  (filters; combination of segmentations via voting and STAPLE;
  shape-based averaging), statistics (t-tests; general linear
  regression).
