Psychophysics
*************

Our goal is to equip Debian systems with FOSS solutions to carry out any
experiment relating physical stimuli and their psychological effects.

Status
------

We have already made some popular tools, such as :ref:`PyEPL
<pkg_python-pyepl>` and :ref:`Psychopy <pkg_psychopy>`, a part of the official
Debian_ distribution and working on extending support of other tools and
libraries used in psychophysics research to interface with the stimuli delivery
and responses collection hardware.

.. todo:: Tailor Debian_ for psychophysics research

   * Complete packaging of :ref:`Psychtoolbox-3 <pkg_octave-psychtoolbox-3>`
   * Provide convenience package and guidelines for assuring robust
     performance of the provided stimuli presentation software (e.g. setting
     permissions for enabling RT scheduling, memory locking etc)
