Neural Modeling
***************

We aim to cover tools for scientists interested in modeling of real neural
systems at different levels (from single neuron to complex networks).


Status
------

This effort initiated with packaging of :ref:`Brian <pkg_python-brian>`
and :ref:`PyNN <pkg_python-pynn>` already available from Debian_ and NeuroDebian_ repositories.

.. todo::  Neural modeling software coverage

   * Complete packaging of :ref:`PCSIM <pkg_python-pcsim>`
   * Complete packaging of :ref:`NEURON <pkg_neuron>`
