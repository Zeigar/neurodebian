The team
========

`Michael Hanke <http://mih.voxindeserto.de>`_ and `Yaroslav Halchenko
<http://www.onerussian.com>`_ originally started NeuroDebian (formerly the
`Experimental Psychology Debian packaging project
<http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-exppsy>`_) and are the current project
leaders. However, the whole project would not be possible without the work of
over 3,000 Debian_ developers and contributors who are as enthusiastically
building the Debian operating system.
A number of packages that are available from the NeuroDebian repository have
been contributed by various individuals and other teams in Debian, such as
`Debian Med`_ and `Debian Science`_. We want to express our gratitude to all
maintainers_ that help to make Debian_ the ultimate software platform for
neuroscience.
