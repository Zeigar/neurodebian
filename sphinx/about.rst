About NeuroDebian
*****************


`Michael Hanke <http://mih.voxindeserto.de>`_ and `Yaroslav Halchenko
<http://www.onerussian.com>`_ originally started NeuroDebian and remain the
current project leaders. However, the whole project would not be possible
without the work of over 3,000 Debian_ developers and contributors who are as
enthusiastically build the Debian operating system. Moreover, various packages
that are available through NeuroDebian have been contributed by other
individuals and teams in Debian, such as `Debian Med`_ and `Debian Science`_.
We want to express our gratitude to all maintainers_ that help to make Debian_
the ultimate software platform for neuroscience.
