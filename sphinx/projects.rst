********************
NeuroDebian Projects
********************

We share a lot of common interests with other teams in Debian.  So we are
actively collaborating with `Debian Med`_ and `Debian Science`_ projects to
improve Debian_ infrastructure and software coverage to fulfil our goals.

This page provides an overview of current and planned NeuroDebian_ projects. Each description
lists a couple of tasks remaining to reach the goal of a
particular project. If you want to contribute, take a look at them and email the
neurodebian-devel_ mailing list with your intention to help.


Expanding coverage
------------------

* :ref:`project_matlab`
* Neuroimaging

  - :ref:`project_afni`
  - :ref:`Packaging SPM8 <project_matlab>`
  - :ref:`project_freesurfer`

* :ref:`project_psychophysics`
* :ref:`project_electrophysiology`
* :ref:`Neural modeling <project_neuralmodeling>`

Please refer to the `complete list of perspective packages
<http://qa.debian.org/wnpp.php?login=team%40neuro.debian.net>`_ which we are
working on (|ITP|\s) or just placed on the radars of Debian project (|RFP|\s).


Infrastructure
--------------

* :ref:`project_debtest`
* :ref:`project_snapshots`
* :ref:`coffeeart`


Cross-platform availability
---------------------------

* :ref:`chap_vm`
* Live CD (`preliminary version <http://neuro.debian.net/debian/live/>`_)
* Cloud computing


Expertise transfer
------------------

* `Best practices for deploying scientific software <https://github.com/neurodebian/SciDeployGuide>`_
* Advise (e.g. on legal, deployment aspects) and contribute upstream projects
* Whenever necessary mentor and sponsor uploads of relevant projects into Debian_


Promotion
---------

* `Publications <http://neuro.debian.net/index.html#publications>`_ and
  promotional materials

  - `Debian / NeuroDebian tri-fold
    <http://neuro.debian.net/_files/brochure_debian-neurodebian.pdf>`_

* Conferences presence.  To promote NeuroDebian_ project we consider
  (conditioned on funding and agreements with organizers) presenting
  NeuroDebian_ at

  - `HBM 2011 <http://www.humanbrainmapping.org/HBM2011>`_
  - `Invite us <mailto:team@neuro.debian.net>`_

* `Inviting contributions and new members to join the NeuroDebian project
  <https://openhatch.org/+projects/NeuroDebian>`_
