Final call for neuroscience research software in Debian 7.0
===========================================================

*** FREEZE IN SUMMER 2012 ***

There are only few weeks left till the Debian project will freeze its *testing*
suite in preparation for the upcoming release of Debian 7.0 (wheezy).  This
freeze will most likely happen in June 2012. If the Debian packages of your
favorite neuroscience research software are not yet up-to-date -- or worse,
there are no packages in Debian yet -- it is time to act **NOW**!

Software (updates) that do not get uploaded within the next two to three weeks
are in danger of not making it into the release candidate in time before the
freeze. If you miss this opportunity, there won't be a chance to get into the
flagship of free and open source operation systems for a couple of *years*...

Get in touch with your local Debian developer to discuss what can still be done.
