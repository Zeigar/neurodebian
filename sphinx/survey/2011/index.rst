 The 2011 survery of software usage in neuroscience research
*************************************************************

In May 2011, we conducted an online survey in which we asked neuroscientists to
share some details about their computing environments. We were interested in
what operating systems they are using do conduct their research.  In what
environments they are working, for what fraction of their time? How long they
need to spend on non-research maintenance activies? And we asked them about
their opinion on certain aspects of the operating systems they are using.
Finally we also wanted to know where they obtain the software they need, and
which particular applications they are using.

Within 12 days, a total of 583 participants from 44 countries responded to the
survey. The main results of this survey have been published in the journal
`Frontiers in Neuroinformatics`:
