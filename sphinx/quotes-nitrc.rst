   brilliant! as promised, all problems are [on their way to being] solved. (well, at least in so far as neuroscience is concerned :) very cool and as pointed out, NeuroDebian lets you try out all the cool toys of neuroscience research with a very straightforward ease of use (esp. with the virtual machine). very nice...keep up the good work!

   Dr. Halchenko's statement "Discover http://neuro.debian.net and be happy" may sound a bit like a sales pitch, but it is rather good advice.  We have been experimenting with the rapid instantiation of computational environments containing neuroimaging tools from NITRC, and the NeuroDebian repository makes installing and updating the tools through apt-related package managers rather trivial.
