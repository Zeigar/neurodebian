    Developing informatics infrastructure often involves building
    complex systems that require interaction between existing
    components such as software and atlases.  NeuroDebian makes it
    trivial to manage the components of these systems, freeing me to
    focus on the novel and important aspects of my work.

   For proper software packaging and distribution, the NeuroDebian project provides professional expertise and infrastructure.

   As a system administrator, I support the efforts of a number of
   researchers who use fMRI analysis software. I was overjoyed to find
   the NeuroDebian repository, a one-stop shop for nearly every
   software package the researchers use. The work of the NeuroDebian
   Team greatly simplifies the task of providing our researchers the
   best software available, and I consider the repository a vital part
   of my professional life.  As a maintainer on the MRIConvert
   project, I find that NeuroDebian provides a valuable venue for
   dissemination of our software. It would not be possible to reach
   the same wide audience without the NeuroDebian repository.

    Neurodebian is the best solution for researchers in neuroscience.
    Everybody should have experienced wasting so much time in just setting
    up software. With Neurodebian repository, you can easily setup many
    useful software packages and focus on your research. I recommend this
    repository to everyone who is interested in using Linux in
    neuroscience.

    We use NeuroDebian on a daily basis as it provides a stable and
    versioned software base for analysis. This is critical as it allows us
    to maintain data provenance, something that is often sorely lacking.
    Our collaborators who don't quite have their heads around Linux yet
    are pointed to the NeuroDebian Virtual Machine, it allows them to run
    an identical analysis environment to us regardless of where they are
    or operating system.

    NITRC-CE, or the NITRC Computational Environment, on the Amazon
    Marketplace wouldn't have happened as quickly and thus cost effectively
    without leveraging NeuroDebian's good works. We appreciate their
    critical contribution to the neuroimaging compute community.

   For any neuroscientist that relies on open-source software,
   NeuroDebian is the single most important resource.

   With NeuroDebian we can utilize thousands of tools, providing the foundation for our research. On the other hand, we can provide our tools to a large community easily.

   Thanks to NeuroDebian I now have to spend my time thinking hard about what to do with the tools, rather than leisurely installing them and tracking dependencies.﻿

   [...] those wonderful tools in Debian Neuro [...] make my life as a
   researcher who also maintains a bunch of Debian boxes so much easier.

   I am a dedicated R user ... and have a Windows box. But this
   afternoon I (finally) downloaded and installed NeuroDebian and the
   VirtualBox, ran AFNI, and generated the files I needed, all within
   about an hour and a half. [...] not bad, considering that I know
   essentially no Linux/Unix. So here's a big "thanks!" :)

  Neurodebian provides us with a consitent way of sotware packaging
  and upgrades, eliminating tedious compiles and home-brew setups,
  while seamlessly integrating with the Debian distribution. Excellent
  and very valuable work, saving costs and difficult to spot
  errors. High five Michael, Yaroslav and team! Keep them packages
  coming!

   Since I started using a NeuroDebian virtual machine on win64 months
   ago I am relying more and more on its diverse tools, from
   population-specific template creation to pipelining the analysis of
   fMRI, DTI and morphology studies. There is a great chance I will
   end up working exclusively with NeuroDebian!

   Without NeuroDebian we would have wasted precious time for
   deploying software, and we wouldn't have tested so many software
   tools.
