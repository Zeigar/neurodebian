   [...] those wonderful tools in Debian Neuro [...] make my life as a
   researcher who also maintains a bunch of Debian boxes so much easier.

   I am a dedicated R user ... and have a Windows box. But this
   afternoon I (finally) downloaded and installed NeuroDebian and the
   VirtualBox, ran AFNI, and generated the files I needed, all within
   about an hour and a half. [...] not bad, considering that I know
   essentially no Linux/Unix. So here's a big "thanks!" :)
