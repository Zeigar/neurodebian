   Since 2007 we completely rely on the NeuroDebian project to provide users of the Debian/Ubuntu platform with FSL software packages and corresponding technical support.  [...] we have received a continuous stream of bug fixes and improvements that have been developed by members of the Debian community.  [...] we were able to benefit from work of people that would not otherwise contribute to the development of FSL ‚Äì without any additional investment of my lab, but solely due to FSL‚Äôs presence in the Debian archive.

   [...] NeuroDebian allows both researchers and the public to easily replicate the entire experimental procedure, a feature rendered difficult or often impossible by proprietary software packages that most scientists rely on nowadays.  I have been increasingly using NeuroDebian in a Virtual Machine because Linux operating systems are not supported by the university.  [...] Moreover, powered by NeuroDebian‚Äôs openness, I see a reason to publish the full code of our experimental and analysis scripts. [NeuroDebian] makes the goal of open science finally viable.
