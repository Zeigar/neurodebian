   The approach taken with NeuroDebian is plainly the most appropriate approach to software distribution for the dominant platform in brain image analysis, and I have great confidence that this project will be a major asset to the neuroscience community in facilitating the distribution of stable software, improving the reliability and replicability of analyses, and in helping to improve software development practices.

   Having common software stacks makes sharing much easier, potentially (and silently) saving enormous amounts of money and effort and dramatically increasing efficiently and productivity in not one, but many labs. NeuroDebian is of particular utility in these regards.

   [...] your team are ideally placed to make this system work. I have worked with Yaroslav Halchenko and Michael Hanke.  [...] Their record on working together as a team, and individually, is easy to find, and speaks for itself.  Their demonstrated combination of seemingly inexhaustible energy, openness and skill has been of enormous benefit to our own project and community.

   Having such a group of experts [NeuroDebian developers] that search for open-source software solutions, refine them and then make them trivially easy for users to install and try out is of absolutely invaluable benefit to the research community and to the funding bodies that would, otherwise, be paying much larger sums in commercial software licensing fees.

   NeuroDebian is playing a key role in the creation of an ``eco-system'' of open-source solutions for neuroscience  [...] The standards and practices disseminated by the NeuroDebian project allowed me to start using this tool [PsychoPy] efficiently and rapidly and to contribute back to the project within a few months.

   Since 2007 we completely rely on the NeuroDebian project to provide users of the Debian/Ubuntu platform with FSL software packages and corresponding technical support.  [...] we have received a continuous stream of bug fixes and improvements that have been developed by members of the Debian community.  [...] we were able to benefit from work of people that would not otherwise contribute to the development of FSL – without any additional investment of my lab, but solely due to FSL’s presence in the Debian archive.
